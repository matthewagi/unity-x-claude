# Unity x Claude

> **Give Claude full control of the Unity Editor.** 20 tools for scripts, scenes, components, assets, settings, and builds — all through the Model Context Protocol.

A lightweight MCP server that runs directly inside Unity's editor process. It uses a single background thread with kernel-level socket polling, so it costs **zero CPU when idle** and responds instantly when Claude sends a command. No async, no ThreadPool, no external runtimes — pure C# with raw socket I/O.

---

## Why Use This?

- **Talk to Unity in plain English** — ask Claude to create scripts, build scenes, tweak physics settings, or kick off a build
- **Zero performance impact** — the server sleeps until Claude talks to it. Your editor stays snappy.
- **Works with any MCP client** — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or anything that speaks MCP
- **Always on** — starts automatically with Unity, survives domain reloads and recompiles
- **Fully undoable** — every destructive operation goes through Unity's Undo system

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy the package into your Unity project

```
YourProject/
  Packages/
    com.claude.unity-mcp/       <-- copy this entire folder here
      Editor/
      package.json
      mcp-bridge.mjs
```

You can clone this repo and copy the files, or add it as a local package.

### 2. Open Unity

The package auto-compiles. You'll see in the console:

```
[MCP] Ready on port 9999
```

Open **Window > Claude MCP** to verify the server is running and see all available tools.

### 3. Configure your MCP client

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop (recommended)</strong></summary>

Add to your config file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/FULL/PATH/TO/YourProject/Packages/com.claude.unity-mcp/mcp-bridge.mjs"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** Open Window > Claude MCP in Unity and click **Copy Config** to get this JSON with the correct path pre-filled.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code / Cursor / Direct HTTP</strong></summary>

If your client supports Streamable HTTP transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "url": "http://localhost:9999/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### 4. Restart your MCP client

Restart Claude Desktop or your MCP client. It connects to Unity's MCP server automatically.

### 5. Verify the connection

In Claude, ask it to do something in Unity — e.g. "What's in my scene?" or "Create a cube". If Claude can read your scene hierarchy, you're connected. If it says "Cannot connect", check that Unity is open and the MCP status window shows "Running".

> **Important:** The `mcp-bridge.mjs` path in your config must point to the currently open Unity project. If you switch projects, update the path and restart Claude Desktop.

## Documentation

This repo includes two detailed guides for getting the most out of the MCP tools:

| Guide | What it covers |
|-------|---------------|
| **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)** | Tool quick reference, common workflows (creating characters, setting up scenes, bulk material edits, debugging), property path reference for all common components, settings categories, depth strategy |
| **[WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)** | Full setup walkthrough, architecture deep-dive, known gotchas (primitive creation workaround), runtime data during Play mode, testing pipeline with screenshots, domain reload lifecycle, `execute_csharp` notes, SerializedProperty paths |

**If you're using this as a Claude skill**, copy `SKILL.md` into your Claude skills folder so Claude always has the tool reference available.

        | stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0)
        v
  mcp-bridge.mjs                    Node.js — translates stdio <-> HTTP
        |
        | HTTP POST localhost:9999/mcp
        v

        |-- MainThreadDispatcher       ConcurrentQueue + AutoResetEvent
        |-- JsonRpcHandler             JSON-RPC 2.0 message parsing
        |-- Tools/*                    20 tool handlers
        |-- Serialization/*            GameObjectSerializer, AssetSerializer, etc.
```

### How it stays at zero CPU when idle

| Component | What happens when idle |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `StreamableHttpServer` | Single thread blocked on `Socket.Poll(1s)` — true kernel wait, zero CPU |
| `MainThreadDispatcher` | `ConcurrentQueue.TryDequeue` returns false — one boolean check per frame (~0 ns) |
| `MCPServer.Tick()` | One `EditorApplication.update` callback, nanosecond cost when queue is empty |
| Status Window | No continuous repaint — only updates on user interaction |

**No async. No Task. No ThreadPool. No polling loops. No timers.**

## Status Window

Open **Window > Claude MCP** in Unity to monitor and control the server:

- **Start / Stop** — manually control the server
- **Enable / Disable** — toggle auto-start on editor launch
- **Restart** — stop + start (useful after config changes)
- **Port** — default 9999, configurable in Advanced Settings
- **Copy Config** — copies the MCP client config JSON to your clipboard with the correct path

---

## Compatibility

| | Supported |
|---|-----------|
| **Unity** | 2021.3 LTS and newer (tested on Unity 6.0) |
| **Render Pipeline** | URP, HDRP, Built-in |
| **OS** | macOS, Windows |
| **MCP Clients** | Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Can't connect to the MCP server**
- Make sure Unity is open with the MCP package installed
- Check **Window > Claude MCP** — status should show "Running"
- Verify nothing else is using port 9999 (`lsof -i :9999` on macOS)

**Server not starting automatically**
- Open Window > Claude MCP and make sure the Enable toggle is on
- The server auto-starts via `[InitializeOnLoad]` after every domain reload

**Port conflict**
- Open Window > Claude MCP > Advanced Settings
- Change the port (e.g., 10000)
- Update your MCP client config to match the new port

**Bridge not connecting (Claude Desktop)**
- Make sure Node.js is installed (`node --version`)
- Verify the path to `mcp-bridge.mjs` in your Claude config is correct
- Restart Claude Desktop after changing the config

## Using as a Claude Skill

For the best experience, copy `SKILL.md` into your Claude skills directory so Claude always has the full tool reference, property paths, and workflow patterns loaded. This means Claude will know exactly how to use every tool without you having to explain anything.

```
~/.claude/skills/unity-mcp/SKILL.md
```

The `WORKFLOW.md` covers advanced topics like runtime data inspection, screenshot-based testing, domain reload handling, and known gotchas with workarounds.

---

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. If you add a new tool, follow the existing pattern in `Editor/Tools/` — each tool is a static method with a `[Tool]`-style registration in `MCPServer.cs`. Update `SKILL.md` with the new tool's usage patterns and `WORKFLOW.md` if there are any gotchas.
